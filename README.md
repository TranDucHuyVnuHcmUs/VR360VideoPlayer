# VR360VideoPlayer
Play video on a sphere, then go inside it to watch. Maybe add some other controls too.

# Configurations
This project is made and tested in:
- Unity 2022.2.14f1
- Google Cardboard VR SDK (newest, 5/5/2023)

# How to do?
If anyone's interested, please send me a DM, or you can create an issue in this repo, so I'll consider making a video about building this project from scratch.

- Find/Make 360 videos and import them to Unity.
- Follow the guide from [Google Cardboard VR SDK](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/develop/unity/quickstart) (remember to follow it fully!)
- Copy the important components/objects from Google Cardboard VR SDK's sample into your own scene, such as CardboardStartup component, Main Camera with TrackedPoseDriver component, CardboardReticlePointer...
- Add a sphere, attach VideoPlayer component on the sphere, attach a VideoClip to the VideoPlayer component
- Make an unlit shader, and add line "Cull Front" to allow Unity to show the inside of the sphere, then make a material based on this shader, and attach this material onto the sphere.
- Bring the camera to the center of the sphere.
- Make Dropdown and time Slider UI. Link these two's on value changed event to the function that choose the video, or control the current playing time of the VideoPlayer.
- Add 2 cube, one for playing/resuming video and other for pausing the video.
- Change the layer of these 2 cube into the layer that you want CardboardReticlePointer to act on.
- Implement gaze interaction component, using 2 float variable (gazing time and threshold) to allow user to look at the object and call the event once the gazing time are longer or equal the time threshold.
